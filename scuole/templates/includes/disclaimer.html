  <p>
    A-F ratings have not been released for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">2023-2024</span> school year. Many school districts have <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/08/12/texas-school-accountability-ratings-lawsuit/" target="_blank">sued the Texas Education Agency</a> after the agency made changes to the way ratings would be calculated. The ratings wonâ€™t be released until the case is resolved.
