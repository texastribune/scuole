  <p>
    A-F ratings have not been released since the <span style="font-weight: bold;">2021-2022</span> school year. Many school districts have <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/16/texas-accountability-ratings-tea-school-districts-lawsuit/" target="_blank">sued the Texas Education Agency</a> after the agency made changes to the way ratings would be calculated. The ratings wonâ€™t be released until the case is resolved.
