<p>Each year, approximately 300,000 students begin eighth grade in a Texas public school. National employment and earnings statistics suggest that these students will have materially better prospects as adults if they finish high school and enroll in and complete a post-secondary certificate or degree program. Using data from the <a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/">Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board</a> and the <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/">Texas Education Agency</a>, the Tribune is providing a look into the outcomes of students who started eighth grade in a Texas public school from {{ first_cohort }} to {{ latest_cohort }}.</p>
